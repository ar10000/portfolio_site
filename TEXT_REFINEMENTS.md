## 📋 Content Principles Applied

1. **Benefits Over Features:** All descriptions start with what the user gets, not what the tool does
2. **Active Voice:** "I build" not "Products are built"
3. **Specific Numbers:** 48-72 hours, 2-4 weeks, 3 products, 10+ hours/week
4. **Clear CTAs:** Every section has a clear next step
5. **Scannable:** Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings
6. **First Person:** "I turn your ideas" not "Ideas are turned"
7. **Direct:** "Stop waiting months" not "Reduce waiting time"

## 🎯 Remaining Opportunities

1. **Empty States:** Add "No projects yet, but watch this space" where applicable
2. **Loading States:** Add "Brewing something awesome..." to other async operations
3. **Consistent Capitalization:** Review all headings for consistency
4. **Micro-Copy Review:** Check all tooltips, help text, and secondary CTAs

## 📝 Notes

- All text now follows first-person, direct voice
- Problem/solution format makes projects more compelling
- "You get..." sections make services more benefit-focused
- Friendly error messages improve user experience
- Button hover states add personality and engagement
