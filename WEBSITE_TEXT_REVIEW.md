### Where I Am Section

**Section Title:**
Where I Am

**Content:**
I'm transparent about my experience level. I've built production systems with multi-tenant architecture, AI integrations, and real-world deployments. I know how to design data models, handle webhooks with retry logic, and integrate Claude AI with streaming responses.

What I'm still learning: scoping complex projects, estimating timelines perfectly, and business process consulting. That's why my rates (€75/hour) reflect strong technical execution without charging senior consultant rates for expertise I don't have yet.

As I build case studies and client testimonials, my rates will increase. Work with me now to get technical quality at fair pricing.

### How Pricing Works Section

**Section Title:**
How Pricing Works

**Card 1: Start Small**
Every project starts with a 15-minute fit check. Then choose: a €1,200 fixed-scope starter build to test working together, or jump straight to hourly work.

**Card 2: Hourly for Flexibility**
Most ongoing work uses hourly billing at €75/hour. This works well for AI systems, feature development, or projects where requirements evolve. Billed weekly.

**Card 3: Scale to Complete Systems**
Once we've worked together on smaller projects, we can take on complete system builds. These start at €4,500 and scale based on architecture complexity.

### Why This Pricing Section

**Content:**
I'm transparent about where I am in my career. I've built production systems with multi-tenant architecture, AI logic, and real integrations. But I'm still building my client portfolio. This pricing reflects strong technical skills without charging senior consultant rates for business process consulting I'm still learning.

### Common Questions Section

**Section Title:**
Common Questions

**Q: Why no price brackets?**
A: Brackets create confusion and clients anchor to the low end. Fixed prices and "starting at" language set clear expectations.

**Q: What's included in the €1,200 starter build?**
A: A working automation, API integration, or AI tool delivered in 1–2 weeks. Scope is defined upfront. Source code and handoff session included.

**Q: Why €75/hour instead of €50 or €120?**
A: €75 reflects strong technical execution without charging for senior consulting experience I don't have yet. As I build client case studies, rates will increase.

**Q: Do you offer ongoing support?**
A: Yes, at €75/hour. Billed based on actual hours used each month.

**Q: Can you handle complex systems?**
A: Yes. I've built multi-tenant systems, AI agents, and production apps. But these projects start at €4,500 and I recommend starting with a smaller build first.
