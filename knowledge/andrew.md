## Why These Rates

I'm transparent about my experience level. I've built production systems with multi-tenant architecture, AI integrations, and real deployments. I know how to design data models, handle webhooks with retry logic, and integrate Claude AI with streaming responses.

What I'm still learning: scoping complex projects perfectly and business process consulting. That's why €75/hour reflects strong technical execution without charging senior consultant rates.

As I build case studies, rates will increase. Work with me now for technical quality at fair pricing.
